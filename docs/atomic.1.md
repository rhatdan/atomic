# CONNECTING TO DOCKER ENGINE

By default, `atomic` command connects to docker engine via UNIX domain socket
located at `/var/run/docker.sock`. You can use different connection method via
setting several environment variables:

**DOCKER_HOST** — this variable specifies connection string. If your engine
listens on UNIX domain socket, you can specify the path via
`http+unix://<path>`, e.g. `http+unix://var/run/docker2.sock`. For TCP the
string has this form: `tcp://<ip>:<port>`, e.g. `tcp://127.0.0.1:2375`

**DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY** — enables TLS verification if it contains any value,
otherwise it disables the verification

**DOCKER_CERT_PATH** — path to directory with TLS certificates, files in the
directory need to have specific names:

**cert.pem** — client certificate

**key.pem** — client key

**ca.pem** — CA certificate
